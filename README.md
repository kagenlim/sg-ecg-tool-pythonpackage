## Usage

DESCRIPTION
    This package will allow you to enter Subjects you are interested in, or Universities you are keen on, so that you can
    access statistics/information on the latest employment rates and salaries associated with certain courses. This package
    also contains information on the latest openings, for various industries.
    
    To that end, there are 7 functions in this package that provide different capabilities, to empower you on your
    education and career guidance journey.
    
    There is important information in this documentation, as there are some key permissible values that must be keyed into
    certain slots ('arguments'). It will otherwise not be possible to use this package. Where necessary, these will be
    reiterated throughout the documentation.
    
    Values for university_shortname
    ----------
    This is a comprehensive list of the six autonomous universities in Singapore.
    
    You will need to key in the values on the left of the assignment operator ('='), for the
    university_shortname argument. The full names of the universities are to the right of the assignment operator.
    
    The 'sg' in front of the acronyms is an alias that I recommend.
    This can change depending on how you import this package.
    
    - sg.NTU = 'Nanyang Technological University'
    - sg.NUS = 'National University of Singapore'
    - sg.SUTD = 'Singapore University of Technology and Design'
    - sg.SUSS = 'Singapore University of Social Sciences'
    - sg.SIT = 'Singapore Institute of Technology'
    - sg.SMU = 'Singapore Management University'
    
    Values for subject
    ----------
    This is a list of potential subjects you may be interested in pursuing.
    
    These subjects have been titled in a self-explanatory way. You just need to key them in as they are rendered here.
    
    The 'sg' in front of the acronyms is an alias that I recommend.
    This can change depending on how you import this package.
    
    - sg.Business
    - sg.Engineering
    - sg.Computing
    - sg.Education
    - sg.Law
    - sg.Humanities_SocialSci
    - sg.Healthcare
    - sg.Science
    - sg.Design_Art
    
    Values for industry
    ----------
    This is a list of potential industries you may be keen on pursuing.
    
    These values, unlike for the two lists above, must be entered as strings, therefore the inverted commas around them.
    There will be a reminder, for specific modules that utilize industry.
